I'm learning to code online by myself. I saw some youtube videos and did a web development couser on FreeCodeCamp.org
I'm using HTML & CSS in this project to consolidate my learning.
I created a website aimed for mobile devices for my Dad who is a Uber driver.
My goal here is to generate a QRCode of the website, print it and paste it on the car, so passengers have easy access to his contacts and information to schedule private trips.
After I developed everything with a mobile view on my pc, I saw that the desktop version looks terrible, so I'll work on a second version to be responsive looking fine on both mobile and desktops.
